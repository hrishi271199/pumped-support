        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>PUMPED ("we", "our", "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that data.</p>

        <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>When you use PUMPED, we collect the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account information</strong> &mdash; Your name, email address, and username, provided during sign-up via Sign in with Apple.</li>
            <li><strong>Workout data</strong> &mdash; Exercises, sets, reps, weights, and personal records you log in the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Social data</strong> &mdash; Your friends list, friend requests, feed posts, likes, and comments.</li>
            <li><strong>Subscription status</strong> &mdash; Whether you have an active PUMPED Pro subscription, managed entirely through Apple.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To save and sync your workouts and personal records across devices.</li>
            <li>To power social features: your friends can see your PRs in their feed, and you can see theirs.</li>
            <li>To display leaderboards and progress analytics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>Your data is stored securely using Google Firebase (Cloud Firestore and Firebase Authentication). Data is transmitted over encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS). Workout data is also cached locally on your device for offline access.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>PUMPED uses the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firebase Authentication</strong> &mdash; For secure sign-in via Apple.</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud Firestore</strong> &mdash; For storing and syncing your data.</li>
            <li><strong>Apple StoreKit</strong> &mdash; For managing subscriptions. We do not see or store your payment information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.</p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties. The only data visible to other users is what you choose to share through the app's social features (your display name, username, and personal records shared with friends).</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Your data is retained as long as your account is active. If you wish to delete your account and all associated data, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@hrishishah.com">support@hrishishah.com</a> and we will process your request within 30 days.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>PUMPED is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access the personal data we hold about you.</li>
            <li>Request correction of inaccurate data.</li>
            <li>Request deletion of your data.</li>
            <li>Export your workout data.</li>
        </ul>
